Fork of Phantom theme for Athways blog

----------------------

# Phantom

Phantom is a simple and responsive theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). It's compatible with ```Ghost (0.5.2)``` and probably upwards, though this is the testet version.

Take a look at the live demo at: [http://bartinger.at](http://bartinger.at)

If you're using Phantom as your theme I would love to see it. Drop me the URL at [here](https://plus.google.com/+DominicBartl) or send me a [mail](mailto:dominic.bartl.at@gmail.com)

## Configuration
*  Google Analytics 

Edit [partials/analytics.hbs](https://github.com/Bartinger/phantom/blob/master/partials/analytics.hbs) and set parameters to `ga('create', ...)` call.

	<script>
		(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
			(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
			m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
		})(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
		ga('create', 'UA-21512134-2', 'bartinger.at');
		ga('send', 'pageview');
	</script>

*  Disqus

Edit [partials/disqus.hbs](https://github.com/Bartinger/phantom/blob/master/partials/disqus.hbs) and set `disqus_shortname`.

	<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var disqus_shortname = 'bartingerat';
		(function() {
			var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
			dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
			(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);
		})();
	</script>
	<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>

*  Google Webmaster Tools

Edit [default.hbs](https://github.com/Bartinger/phantom/blob/master/default.hbs) and set your `content` value with a tag named `google-site-verification`.

	<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1" />
	<meta name="google-site-verification" content="2sFNa3r5M51jSBOmqrR7s9kJ6ohxsR5CNOkp4I0a2ho" />

	{{! Page Meta }}
	<title>{{meta_title}}</title>

*  Sidebar

Edit [partials/sidebar.hbs](https://github.com/Bartinger/phantom/blob/master/partials/sidebar.hbs) and fix the URLs and remove what's not needed.

	<div class="social-icons">
		<a href="https://github.com/Bartinger" class="icon icon-github"></a>
		<a href="https://plus.google.com/+DominicBartl?rel=author" class="icon icon-gplus"></a>
		<a href="https://twitter.com/DevBartinger" class="icon icon-twitter"></a>
		<a href="/rss" class="icon-rss"></a>
		<a href="mailto:dominic.bartl.at@gmail.com" class="icon-mail"></a>
	</div>



## Features
- Minimalistic responsive
- Google Analytics
- Disqus comments
- Icon-font ([Fontello](/assets/font/config.json))
- Post images<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> I've added them to the post.hbs template to make them discoverable by social sites if someone posts the link to this blog post. Though they are hidden in the template because I wanted to keep it clean. You can enable and style them by editing ```_posts.scss``` or ```standalone/assets/css/main.css``` for standalone users.

## SEO
- Post tags as meta keywords

## Development

### Dependencies

- Grunt
- Sass
- CSS minification
- Deployment via rsync

### Quickstart

```
git clone git@github.com:Bartinger/phantom.git
cd phantom
npm install
npm install -g grunt grunt-cli
bundle
```

### Notes

Using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) for development run ```gunt dev``` which watches the directory and does the ```sass``` compiling. *Note: Livereload extension must be installed, for it to work. I didn't include the connect middleware*.

To package the theme run ```grunt build``` and publish the new generated ```dist``` directory in your ghost theme directory. Run ```grunt compile``` to package the theme in the standalone directory.

## Grunt What?
Even though I highly recommend using Grunt, if you dont't know what it is and don't want to learn it (as a web developer you definitely should) you can use the standalone version. Take the ```standalone``` directory and copy it to your theme directory. It contains the whole theme with unminified css, ready for you to be edited.

This theme is based on the default theme casper.
